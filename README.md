This is the Github repo for Dungeon Delve

Dungeon Delve is a 3D first person dungeon crawler game with Western RPG elements. You can create a character, explore the dungeon, fight monsters, eat chickens, pick locks, and investigate magical artifacts.

Attacks and skill checks are determined by way of dice roll, handled by a system that replicates rolling mechanics in tabletop role-playing games where a dice roll is compared against a difficulty level.

To win, the player needs to collect loot and reach the Dungeon Exit. Loot can be acquired by killing enemies, unlocking treasure chests, and investigating arcane artifacts.

At the moment, the race and level-up/XP system don't have much impact on gameplay, but if I were to revisit this project in the future, I would like to implement functionality where the player's race will have an impact on gameplay (slower XP gain, quicker XP gain, greater health, bonuses to stats, etc), and where the player can bulk up their stats every level-up. Additionally, I would like to have a system where loot gained can act as a currency to purchase items that will help in surviving the dungeon or acquiring more loot (akin to Darkest Dungeon).
